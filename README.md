### Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Model
- The CNN_model function defines a CNN architecture for image classification.
- It consists of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
- The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss for multi-class classification.
  
### The models are trained and evaluated on the Sign Language MNIST dataset : 
- CNN Model:
  - Training Accuracy: 97.83%
  - Test Accuracy: 99.83%
